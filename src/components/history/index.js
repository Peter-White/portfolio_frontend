                  <p>I came out of college with an associate degree in Computer Systems Technologies in pursuit of a career in networking when, all of a sudden, I decided to make the switch into programming. After all these years I don’t remember what made me jump ship so radically, especially when I already earned my degree towards networking. Maybe it was the fact that setting up a lab for network testing was way too costly compared to setting up a single cheap laptop to build and run Java applications. Maybe I shuddered at a maddening future of endless LAN cable wiring and router configurations as opposed to the clean and elegant landscape of programming. But if I’m being truthful, it was probably because programmers seem to make more money. Probably that.</p>

                <div className="col-md-12">
                  <p>Anyway after that life-changing one-eighty (and a whole lot of math classes), I enrolled in a trial boot camp for Ruby on Rails called Ramp-Up Academy. Here was where I learn most of the basics of programming like variables, if statements, conditionals, loops, functions, imports, actually bringing a laptop to class (not kidding), etc. I got quite a lot of experience out of that 10 week course. It instilled in me a greater understanding of the flow of programming in general. It should also be noted that this course was merely an introduction course to one of Boston’s most prestigious Ruby on Rails coding boot camps - Launch Academy - where I was slated to attend, but…</p>

                <div className="col-md-12">
                  <p>I attended General Assembly instead where I was introduced to many other methods of software development. There I learned about HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, Ruby on Rails, various SQL type databases, and talking to rubber ducks. After slaving over a Mac laptop for 12-weeks and after posting several projects to my Heroku account, I was ready to take on the Boston tech scene as a budding new developer. I didn’t have a lot of experience and had never declared a variable, but no matter! My teachers, the media and all my developers friends said that every day hundreds of new developers were being hired so it went without saying that a junior position was just around the corner.</p>

                  <p>14 months passed and nothing happened. No offers. No leads. Barely any calls. No hope. Anyone who says getting into software is easy has never tried to get into software. It didn’t help that I made every bad decision one could make when looking for work. Whether it was a lousy resume, pickiness in the technology I wanted to learn (never truly got over that), not utilizing all of my job board resources, or just the simple fact that nobody wants to hire an entry level programmer, a grim realization was dawning that being a software developer was about as realistic as being President. I didn’t have the experience, the luck, or the reality TV show to accomplish either so it looked like the days of crafting software were at an end before they even began. That’s life. Oh well.</p>

                </div>
                <div className="col-md-12">
                  <p>Then, just when all seemed lost, a company call AVATAR
                    Computing Inc. (yes all capitals) reached out and offered
                    me a job as an entry level web developer for their
                    government contracts division. My first job as adeveloper!
                    One glitch: this position was an ASP.NET and C# stack and
                    my last 10 projects were coded in Ruby on Rails and Node
                    so I had to learn an entirely new stack while also giving
                    my company a sellable product. But thankfully the project
                    I was given was eerily similar to the project in the
                    ASP.NET uDemy course I had just taken and as a result I
                    got an experience in C# and my company got a fully
                    functional app. All were pleased. As my career and
                    projects grew at AVATAR, I was eventually given a
                    Secret Clearance and a new location at U.S. Army Natick
                    Soldier Systems Center (Natick Labs) as an AVATAR employee
                    working under contract to the Department of Defense. I
                    would commute out there from Boston and develop websites
                    for the DOD in what I imagined would be a bustling room
                    of wired in coders happily tapping away breaking only to
                    toss around a Nerf ball while they shared ideas and
                    strategies. What I got was a single office with crickets.
                    Yep. No co-developers. Design; Me. Scripting; Me. Databases;
                    Me. Debugging; Me. Switching a sentence font from San Sariff
                    to Ariel; Yours truly. But who could complain? After all
                    I was finally employed. I was gaining financial stability,
                    learning skill sets that made me a better programmer, and,
                    for every day that went by, generating precious experience
                    for my resume. This was the start of a better life.

                  <p>You probably guessed since this is written in the past tense something bad must have happened, right? Well, duh! About eight months into my new location at Natick Labs I got a conference call from my company. It turns out the DOA decided to take their developing services in a different direction essentially making the partnership between AVATAR and the DOD DOA. I had about four months until I was officially laid-off and throughout that time I didn’t have a lot to do. I decided that it was time to retrain. I studied Core Java, SQL, algorithms, data structures, and general object-oriented programming. By the time last day of work, when the desk was cleaned, and hands were shook, I already had a good head start on object oriented programming. Looking back, I couldn’t have imagined a better starting point for my career than with my time at AVATAR. I met wonderful people (including my project manager whom I will not name but hope someday will see this), made some of my most complex programs, learned a new language, grew as a programmer, and finally found out who shot JFK (according to the DOD it was an extra-terrestrial from area 51). All in all an interesting 18 months, but life moves on.</p>

                  <p>Since my departure from AVATAR I’ve spent most of my time developing new skills, working on new projects, and even joined a startup company as a conceptual contractor (meaning I don’t get paid but I don’t have to call it interning either). I search the job boards faithfully for the next big opportunity where I can grow into the senior programmer God meant me to be. I also pray to God that it doesn’t involve Wordpress. I never stop. I am learning new coding techniques, implementing them into projects, going to hackathons and meetups, and, as always, spending long hours breathing life into my projects. I’m even going back to code school. Why do I do it? As soul crushing as a job rejection or a run time error can be, it can’t crush that moment of joy when the perfect application passes from my head to my well-worn, coffee-stained laptop. I don’t know when or where the next opportunity lays, but rain or shine, hell or high water, I’m staying wired in.</p>
